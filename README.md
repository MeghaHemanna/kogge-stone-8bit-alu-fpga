# kogge-stone-8bit-alu-fpga
This repository contains the RTL design and FPGA implementation of an 8-bit ALU using a high speed Kogge Stone adder. The design is modular and supports arithmetic, logical, shift/rotate, and comparison operations. The ALU is verified through simulation and synthesized on FPGA with opcode-based control due to limited hardware inputs.
